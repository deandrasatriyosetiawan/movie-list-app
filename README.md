# Moli - Movie List Mobile App
## Description
This repository is where my first mobile app project are stored. I worked on this app for 3 days, from 21 January to 23 January 2023. This movie list mobile app developed using Dart programming language and Flutter framework. All of the movie data in Moli comes from API (Application Programming Interface) that provided by [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Moli provides list of movies based on trending, top rated, and genre. The list of genre movies in this app are action, adventure, animation, comedy, family, fantasy, horror, mystery, romance, and thriller.
## Authors
Moli - Movie List Mobile App was developed by me. This movie list app was designed by my dearest woman, [@relzzy](https://github.com/relzzy). Moli is my first mobile app project, which I collaborated on with her. Behind all the hard times when I developed this app, she always accompanied, supported, and helped me. Thank you my honey, I love you ðŸ–¤.
